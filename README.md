#  HIPE: Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities
HIPE is a series of evaluation campaigns on named entity processing on historical newspapers in multiple languages.

## [CLEF HIPE 2020](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020/)
In 2020, we organized a [first successful evaluation campaign](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020/) on named entity processing on historical newspapers in French, German and English. 
It was organized in the context of the [impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch) and run as a [CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/).

## [CLEF HIPE 2022](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2022)
In 2022, we will have an extended evaluation campaign hosted by [CLEF](https://clef2022.clef-initiative.eu/). The new website for CLEF HIPE 2022  will be online soon.
