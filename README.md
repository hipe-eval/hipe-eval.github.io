#  HIPE: Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities
HIPE is a series of evaluation campaigns on named entity processing on historical documents in multiple languages.

## [CLEF HIPE 2026](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2026)
In 2026, HIPE shifts focus from named entity recognition to **relation extraction**, with an emphasis on identifying **person–place relations** in **multilingual historical newspapers**. Participants are asked to assess whether a person was ever at a given place (`at`) or present in the immediate context (`isAt`), based on textual evidence and temporal cues.

Building on a pilot study and prior editions, HIPE-2026 introduces a new **three-way classification task**, where systems must label each relation as `true`, `plausible`, or `false`. The [CLEF lab](https://clef2026.clef-initiative.eu/labs/hipe/) includes two evaluation profiles — one prioritizing accuracy, the other rewarding efficiency and scalability. A surprise test set from a different domain supports evaluation of **domain generalization**.

As in previous editions, all datasets will be publicly released to support **transparency**, **reusability**, and **continued research** in historical text processing.

## [CLEF HIPE 2022](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2022)
In 2022, we organize an extended evaluation campaign on NE processing on historical documents of various types and languages, hosted by [CLEF](https://clef2022.clef-initiative.eu/). The new website for CLEF HIPE 2022  is available [here](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2022/).

## [CLEF HIPE 2020](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020/)
In 2020, we organized a [first successful evaluation campaign](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020/) on named entity processing on historical newspapers in French, German and English. 
It was organized in the context of the [impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch) and run as a [CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/).
